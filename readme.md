# Kalvium Lab | Superwars Stage 1

## Introduction

Dustin and Lucus are best friends. They spend their weekends watching superhero series and playing superhero games. On one fine Friday at school, Mr.Hooper, the computer science faculty, taught them HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dustin & Lucus realized they could build super cool superhero stuff using their knowledge.

The subsequent weekend, they decided to do it. Lucus and Dustin are now all set to build something super cool.

Lucus always loves protagonists, like most of us. But Dustin is quite crazy, and he likes antagonists. So they decided to collect a bunch of their favorite Super Heroes and Super Villains' names and pictures. Did they tell you about the game that they are going to build?

Okay, let us explain. They are going to facilitate the ultimate war between Super Heroes and Super Villains. As they are new to these technologies, they need **Kalvians** to help them build this game.

2. Using `CSS Grid`, create three columns, one each for Heroes, score, and Villains, respectively. Try to make it responsive and find the right size for each grid.
3. Add players to the left and right grids. Use the middle grid to showcase the scores.
4. Style the elements in `style.css`.
